To add a table:

1) Ensure that DB table has "ID" column with type "bigint"
2) Create a class with DR_<TABLENAME> as name, replace <TABLENAME> with the name of th table
3) Inherit DR_<TABLENAME> from DataRecord
4) If you want TimeCreated and TimeModified, add those columns to the table with TIMECREATED,TIMEMODIFIED as names, timestamp without time zone as data type
5) Add ZoliloTableCache<DR_<TABLENAME>> to ZoliloCache.cs
6) Construct the cache object, add it to cacheDict, and add a strongly typed property, to make it look like the others
7) in DatabaseDefinitionManager.cs, in SetDatabaseSchemaObjects, add an entry for that table

There may be other caveats as well.  Check the examples in the other table classes for more information

If the Table will also be a node:

8) Add a GraphNode inherited class
9) Add the node type to the NodeType enum in GraphEdge.cs
10) Add a folder for the Node under the Data\Nodes folder
11) In that folder, Add a NodeEdge code file, using other similar files as a template
12) Inherit the DR_<TABLENAME> from NodeRecord
13) Add ResolveFromDatabase Method to GraphNode file
