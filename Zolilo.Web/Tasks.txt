Querystring not passing in url command

When window.history.pushstate is enabled, then paths more than one directory deep will cause a redirect to the original url that was entered.  
Disabling javascript will stop this.
new uframe gets spawned when this happens




Detect if control is loaded

Ensure that one ZoliloInnerControl is loaded and referenceable

Load scripts within ZoliloInnerControl

Override anchor tags with Ajax

Implement tab container

Test each page's functionality

Clean up code

Modularize Code



---------











*1. Go to goal selector
*2. On Load:
*3. Create Select * From Goals query
*4. Load result set into control
*5. Display contents in browser
 
(Now you will be able to see a crude list of goals and select a goal from the list to view it)
 
*6. Go to Fragment Editor
*7. Edit Text (LRA)
*8. Create Submit Button
*9. On submit: Load fragment into DB
 
(Now you will be able to add a fragment to the database)

---
Create abstract data types for:

Goal
Fragment
*

Create command-line style retrieval commands

Add Tabcontrol to main page
DynamicPopulate on all hyperlinks

Goalview: Add support to display fragments


10. Add a simple fragment viewer which will display the assigned fragment within a control on the screen

 
11. Add functionality for adding fragment to parent fragment
12. Add functionality for setting base weight
 
(Now the fragments that are being added can have basic "structure" to them)
 

 
(Now there will be a way to view a fragment)
 
13. Add default "description" fragment to be attached to each goal
[Description fragment will consist of a goal with weight of 1 (positive) and a LRA which states "Description of Goal" -- The sub-fragments will be used to actually describe the goal]
 
(Now the goals will have a description)
 
14. Show website to one expert person (Walt) and re-evaluate development priorities






ALL IDS should start with 1 and increment by 1
ALL tables need to have these columns

"ID" BIGINT 
"TIMECREATED" timestamp
"TIMEMODIFIED" timestamp


*Cache*

Must be distributed
Must be directly writeable
